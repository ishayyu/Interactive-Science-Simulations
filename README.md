# Interactive-Science-Simulations
A collection of interactive physics and engineering simulations built with HTML5 and JavaScript. Explore fluid dynamics, gravity, rockets, chaotic systems, and planetary motion in real-time.
Welcome to Interactive Science Simulations! This project contains five hands-on simulations that demonstrate fundamental principles of physics and engineering:

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) – Simulate 2D fluid flow with adjustable viscosity and sources.

2D Black Hole Gravity – Watch particles spiral under a central gravitational force.

2D Rocket Launch – Explore thrust, drag, gravity, and trajectory with real-time telemetry.

Double Pendulum – Observe chaotic motion in a coupled pendulum system.

Solar System – Model planetary orbits and gravitational interactions in 3D.

Each simulation includes:

An interactive <canvas> interface

Adjustable parameters

Downloadable source code for experimentation
